# Local services with Docker

Requirements are latest docker engine and docker compose.

Run `sudo docker-compose up -d` inside `local-services/docker`.

MongoDB will work with the default dev configuration, so no additional environment variables are needed. You can browse the databases with Mongo Express by going to http://localhost:8081
